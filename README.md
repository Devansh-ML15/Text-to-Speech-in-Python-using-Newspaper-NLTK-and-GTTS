In this project, we have created a Python program that will help to create voice speech synthesized from the text given. This Python program is helpful for users who cannot see but want to read any online articles.
The main advantage of this project is that just by entering any link of any article, it will create an audio file within the project folder.
Many more advantages of the Text to Speech Conversion project is as follows:
1) It helps to listen to class notes, textbooks, and electronic text(which are available online).
2) It avoids eyestrain from too much reading.
3) It helps in learning languages which we don't know.
4) It helps people in preparation of speeches by hearing your work read aloud.
5) It helps in listening to e-books or e-material during the journey.
6) It helps seniors or those having vision problems.
